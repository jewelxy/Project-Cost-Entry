## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

```Run:```
PORT=3001 npm start

This will start the app on a different port (e.g., http://localhost:3001).

### Environment Variables Not Loading

#### Ensure:
* You have created a ```.env``` file.
* You restarted the server after modifying ```.env```.

### API Not Fetching Data
* Check if your backend is running and accessible.
* Ensure ```REACT_APP_BASE_API_URL``` is correctly set in .env.
* Verify network requests using the browserâ€™s developer console ```(F12 > Network tab)```.
